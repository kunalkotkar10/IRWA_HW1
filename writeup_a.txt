The code provided uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify whether a period indicates the End of Sentence or not. Different features are added to increase the accuracy of the model. The initial features provided gave an accuracy of around 0.90. Adding more features showed observable improvements in the accuracy. Few notable features included are if the immediare word before or after the period belongs to the class of "unlikely proper nouns", there are high chances that the period represents and End of Sentence. 

The features which seemed to work well were checking whether the words before the period was an abbreviation or not. Similarly, if the length of the word before and after the period was less than 2, the period most probably did not denote an end of sentence. I also created a "quote list" of my own which checked whether the character after the period was a quotation mark or not. In such cases, it denoted an end of sentence. Also, figuring out the parts of speech before and after a period also helps us estimate an end of sentence. Hence, I created my own dictionary which consisted all the words in the dataset along with their parts of speech and added the comparison as a feature as well. All these features seemed to significantly improve the accuracy of my model. In my own system, I got an accuracy of 0.996 with all the features included.

I also commented out a lot of features as they did not seem to contribute much towards the accuracy, for eg., checking whether the word after the period belonged to title or not. Also, checking whether a Noun existed before or after the period, etc. This is mostly because there are numerous cases where a noun or a title before or after the period may denote an end of sentence and also in many cases it may not. We need other features to be sure which period denotes what.
